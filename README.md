# MultiplexMegastore
Problem: The Multiplex Megastore is a retailler for household products and needs a new system to allow sales associates on the store floor to assist customers by checking product availability

**Data colletction** led to the following items being included in the system:
* A screen to display the details of the item being requested, including the price and current inventory
* An interface to allow the sales associate to request the item be brought from inventory to the store floor to the customer
* An interface to determine the availability and to reserve the product at another store location
